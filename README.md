A repository to share my sample Python and 'R' scripts. 
All PHI have been scrubbed from the scripts. The scripts are not runable as is without the associated data files as they are not yet publically available. 

The Python scripts generate various maps from modeled PM2.5 data for the state of Alaska from 2005-2020. 
This data is in the form of a series of monthly NETcdf files. An example of the output is below: 

![Borough-level PM2.5 attributable to wildfires](https://github.com/NelshaAth/Sample-Scripts/assets/80352283/db3cb824-c228-4113-a12b-0417c18aa3a1)

The R scripts generate a markdown report of statistics and plots for the data from a network of 22 TSI BlueSky monitors I deployed in Fairbanks, Alaska, for the UAA Wood Smoke Study. 
The markdown report was used to generate a seven-page, easy-to-understand report for each participant's household.
